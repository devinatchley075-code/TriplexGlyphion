# Glyph: Complexity Ledger (CGL-001)

(Template layout: metadata top-left · glyph central · lineage top-right · narrative scroll bottom)

## Glyph Central

Glyph ID: `CGL-001`
Symbol: Spiral Flame ("Complexity Fold")
Representative Summary: "Tri-metric fold combining entropy reduction, semantic integrity, and lineage fidelity to compress multi-domain knowledge into a single, ledger-anchored glyph."

## Metadata (top-left)

- Classification strength: 0.92
- Emergence level: 0.82 (WE candidates require at least two Wisdom parents)
- Effects: cross-domain compression, narrative condensation, re-expansion provenance
- Mutability: Restricted; requires Δutility > 0 and SIS/GLPI ≥ thresholds

## Lineage (top-right)

Parents (DAG):
- `W1-Resilience` (parent_of: CGL-001) — id: `W1-0001` — anchored: `merkle:abc...`
- `W2-Balance` (parent_of: CGL-001) — id: `W2-0002` — anchored: `merkle:def...`

Lineage invariants:
- Directed Acyclic Graph enforced; cycles rejected by Codex mutate guard.
- Each parent entry must include its ledger anchor (sha256 of codex page) and merkle proof for verification.

## Narrative (bottom scroll)

This Complexity Ledger entry explains how CGL-001 was derived from two Wisdom glyphs (W1, W2) and compressed using the tri-metric audit: ERS, SIS, and GLPI.

Compression story:
1. Input: 500MB ChatGPT export, normalized and tokenized.
2. Baseline compression produced symbolic glyph candidates via deterministic concept mapping.
3. For each candidate we computed:
   - ERS (Entropy Reduction Score): byte-level entropy delta after compression.
   - SIS (Semantic Integrity Score): language-aware TF-IDF/Jaccard baseline (pluggable to embedding later).
   - GLPI (Glyph Loss / Proximity Index): lineage-weighted Damerau–Levenshtein between original glyph sequence and compressed glyph sequence.
4. Apply mutation gate: accept only if ERS >= 0.05, SIS >= 0.80, GLPI >= 0.75, and Δutility (aggregate) > 0.
5. Anchor accepted glyph page into the Ledger with merkle root of the batch and per-entry content hash.

Provenance: all steps logged with timestamps, monotonic sequence numbers, and sha256 hashes for artifacts.

## Audit & Mutation Rules (enforced)

- All mutations must produce an AuditRecord.
- Mutation only accepted if: ERS ↑, SIS ≥ 0.80, GLPI ≥ 0.75, and aggregate utility_delta > 0.
- Codex registry will reject mutations failing these checks with TG_0004 (AUDIT_FAIL_THRESHOLD) and record quarantine events.

## Ledger Anchoring Instructions

1. Compute per-entry sha256 of this page's canonicalized bytes.
2. Append to append-only ledger (jsonl) with monotonic sequence number.
3. Batch anchor: compute merkle root over batch entries (sorted lexicographically by entry hash).
4. Publish merkle root and per-entry proof in ledger snapshot.

## Re-expansion Note

Every glyph stores enough narrative & codex pages (Codex pages and linked artifacts) to allow deterministic, audited re-expansion into approximate original content. The ledger anchors, merkle proofs, and glyph mappings are the core of re-expansion guarantees.
